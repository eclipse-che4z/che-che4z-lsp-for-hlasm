Workspace manager encapsulates all functionality of the parser library. It is the access point to all parsing capabilities, keeps the current state of all open files and resolves libraries needed by the analyzer. It also manages when files should be reparsed.

Workspace manager is further described in the following sections:
1. [[Parser library API]]
2. [[Libraries configuration]]
3. [[Workspace manager overview]]
