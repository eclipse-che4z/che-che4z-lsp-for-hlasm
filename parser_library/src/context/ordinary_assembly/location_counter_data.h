/*
   to satisfy the requirements of ORG instructions, multuple location counter data are needed

   suppose that current location counter value equals to 11+X that came from this instructions:
     DS 11C
   A DS (X)C    represented by column 1

   then we use
     ORG A
     DS  (Y)C   represented by column 2

   last we use
     ORG A,,-3
     DS  (Z)C   represented by column 3

   symbols X,Y,Z were not previously defined when used in DS statements
   so we do not know current location counter value

   therefore when we use instruction
    ORG ,       represented by column 4
   we need to compute max of stored previous location counter values to correctly set the value

   =======================================> ORG ,

   from implementation point of view, each column is represented by one location_counter_data object all stored in
   vector of the owning location_counter object any time an involved symbol is defined, the data is updated and the
   vector is reduced accordingly (i.e. when we know, that data will not be a competition in finding maximum)
